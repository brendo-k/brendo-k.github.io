    <p>Hi! Welcome to my first blog post. </p>
<p>This website was built to show off the projects I have completed and write blog posts about things I enjoy learning about. </p>
<p>I mainly got this idea from seeing my friends create personal websites and blogs. From seeing their websites, I thought it was a great way to display what you have done in the past as well as what you are learning currently. Normally, with a project like this I would jump into coding right away. However, this would often fail, I would get burnt out with no concrete idea of what I was creating. Howver, this summer at the Univeristy of Tornoto, Professor Corrin taught me the importance of prototyping. Professor Corrin always stressed that prototypes didn’t need to be complex; they could be wire frames drawn with pencil for all he cared. He wanted to ensure that as a developer, you fully understood the desing and layout you wanted to create and what was the end goal for the completed project. Understanding this helped me move forward with this project. </p>
<p>Getting started, I first prototyped my website using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.invisionapp.com/studio">Invision Studio</a> which I picked up from Professor Corrin’s class. I built the whole website including transitions and navigations between pages and I was pleased with the end result <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://brendenkadota726128.invisionapp.com/prototype/My-Portfolio-ckgvcyfi300lq940110z28d37/play/90857904">(Check it out!)</a>. However, looking back, I feel like I spent too much time finicking over little things like transitions and colouring. I am no UI/UX designer and spending this much time on the prototype was more on finishing it and makinig it look nice rather than udnerstanding what I wanted to build. In the end, my final website didn’t look exactly like my prototype, but it was a useful tool to refrence to understand what I was looking to create.  </p>
