        My name is Brenden Kadota and I am a multidisiplinary programmer with extensive expreience solving 
        biological problems with software applications. I grew up in Vancouver Canada and recently graduated from 
        McGill University wth a degree in honours computer science and biology. </p>

        My most recent research experience was with Dr. Near at the Douglas Mental Heatlh 
        University Institute. I worked on extending functionallity of FID-A, a MRS toolbox, to 
        process MRSI data as well. MRSI is a relativly novel technique that obtains a brain image of
        spacial motabolite concentrations. The toolbox creates a processing pipeline for MRSI data 
        that allows researchers to fully process and visualizer their scans. An addiional function was 
        a creation of a simulation package that can take any MRSI scan and calculuates scan metrics, like scan time
        and magnetic gradient strength.

        For my honours project, I was given the opprotunity to work on a game called Ribo. Ribo leverages
        human pattern recognition to help solve the problem of aligning multiple sequences of DNA. It sends sections of 
        DNA to the player (5-10 sequneces, each around 50-100 nucleotides long) to align. In Unity, I built tools for players 
        than can help them increase their alignment scores and complete puzzles faster. Further, I implemented a new
        schoring scheme to Ribo that insentivies better alignments then the last.

        At the Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, I worked on testing a novel algorithm called km. 
        I used samples for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset to test <i>km</i> on common known mutations which 
        were found on the Genomic Commons Data Portal. I would test this algorithm using cluster computing and report 
        on the accuracy and specificity. Further, I developed a new tool for the algorithm that detected gene fusion
        mutations. I utilized a breadth first search to determine if there were connections between two exons in RNA-Seq data.

        This was my first laboratory experience and this was in my second year at University. Admitedly, I didn't know
        much and stumbled around trying to figure out my research project. I was attempting to recreate a paper where
        they created genetic circuits. Sadly, my project wasn't successful, but it exposed me to the wet lab
        environment and techniques.
