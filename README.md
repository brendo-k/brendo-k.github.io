# My Personal Portfolio

Hello! Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio

[Check it out!](https://brendo-k.github.io/)

## Technologies Used
I used three.js to build the MRI slice viewer. The rest is a static site built with javascript, html and css. 

The MRI sequence used is a T1 weighted turbo spin echo sequence of my brain.

### Things to possibly do
- Make a blog! I love to learn new things and writing/teaching is a great way to solidify knowledge
- Visual demonstrations of my tools. I want to show apps of the models I have built.
- Slide decks. It would be interesting to put my presentation slides up for people to see.
