# My Personal Portfolio

This is a static website I built to show off what I did during my undergraduate degree and write what's on my mind. I bulit this website from scratch using 
the holy trinity of HTML,CSS and JavaScript. The blog posts and project blurbs are written using Hexo, a node.js framework that converts markdown into static pages. This was mainly a learning exercise to understand how to use three languages to build static websites. This is still 
an incomplete project as there are many things I still need to do.
