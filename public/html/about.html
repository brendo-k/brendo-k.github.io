        My name is Brenden Kadota and I am a multidisiplinary programmer with a 
        love of solving problems. I grew up in Vancouver Canada and recently graduated from 
        McGill University studying Honours computer science and biology. I've built various
        software tools for laboratories and I am apsiring to become a bioinformatician.
        </p>
        <p>
        My first biology class was in the first semester of univeristy. I hated it.
        The course was on evolution and phylogenies and didn't interest me at all. However, 
        come second semester I was exposed to molecular biology and genetics. I was instantly 
        interested as there were so many complexities inside DNA. I already had experience with 
        web development so when I saw a degree for computer science and biology, it was a perfect fit. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        At McGill, I was exposed to various research laboratories ranging from neuoimaging to
        video game design. The one component tying my research expreience together 
        was the inclusion of biology problems and building applications to solve those problems. 
        I gained essential expreience from my research and I am excited to use this experience
        in future to combine my knowledge of biology and computer science as a bioinformatician.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am currently looking for work as a bioinformatician or a similar position. If you know an open position
        feel free to reach out!
