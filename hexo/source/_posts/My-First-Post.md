Hi! Welcome to my first blog post. 

This website was built to show off the projects I have completed and write blog posts about things I enjoy learning about. 

I mainly got this idea from seeing my friends create personal websites and blogs. From seeing their websites, I thought it was a great way to display what you have done in the past as well as what you are learning currently. Normally, with a project like this I would jump into coding right away. However, this would often fail, I would get burnt out with no concrete idea of what I was creating. Howver, this summer at the Univeristy of Tornoto, Professor Corrin taught me the importance of prototyping. Professor Corrin always stressed that prototypes didn't need to be complex; they could be wire frames drawn with pencil for all he cared. He wanted to ensure that as a developer, you fully understood the desing and layout you wanted to create and what was the end goal for the completed project. Understanding this helped me move forward with this project. 


Getting started, I first prototyped my website using [Invision Studio](https://www.invisionapp.com/studio) which I picked up from Professor Corrin's class. I built the whole website including transitions and navigations between pages and I was pleased with the end result [(Check it out!)](https://brendenkadota726128.invisionapp.com/prototype/My-Portfolio-ckgvcyfi300lq940110z28d37/play/90857904). However, looking back, I feel like I spent too much time finicking over little things like transitions and colouring. I am no UI/UX designer and spending this much time on the prototype was more on finishing it and makinig it look nice rather than udnerstanding what I wanted to build. In the end, my final website didn't look exactly like my prototype, but it was a useful tool to refrence to understand what I was looking to create.
